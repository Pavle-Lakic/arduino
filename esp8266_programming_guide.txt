ESP8266-12E:
	Programming mode:
		Set GPIO0 to GND.
		Press reset button. You should see LED flash for a moment.
		Connect RX from USB2UART to TX of ESP8266. TX from USB2UART to RX of ESP8266.
		Set Flash mode DIO in Tools tab of Arduino IDE.

	Normal mode:
		After code is uploaded to ESP8266, to get in normal mode first disconnect GPIO0 from protoboard.
		Next set RST to GND for a second, then disconnect it from GND and leave it open.
		Code that was uploaded to ESP8266 should start executing afterwards.
		Connect TX of ESP8266 to OPAMP and scale its value to 5V to prevent error TX messages.
		After that connect output of OPAMP to USB2UART`s RX.

	Switches position:
		To program ESP8266 set all switches to down, then click reset button.
		To set ESP8266 in normal mode, set all switches to up, then click reset button.

ESP8266-01:
	Programming mode:
		Set GPIO0 to GND (switch down) then press reset button. Then unplug GPIO0 from GND (switch up).
		Rest is the same as for ESP8266-12E.
	
	Note:
		OPAMP is not needed for correct output.
